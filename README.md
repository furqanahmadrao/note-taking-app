- JWT authentication with bcrypt for password hashing
- Environment variables for configuration (dotenv)
- Express middleware for request processing (cors, helmet, body parsing)
- PostgreSQL with advanced features (GIN indexes, full-text search, triggers for updated_at)
- Database migrations using SQL files
- Frontend state management with Zustand and React Context API
- Form handling with React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Full-text search using PostgreSQL's tsvector and to_tsvector functions
- Comprehensive note management with pinning, archiving, tagging, and filtering

## Testing

- **Run backend tests:**
  ```bash
  cd backend && npm test
  ```
- **Run API smoke tests:**
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
  ```
- **Run tests in all workspaces:**
  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```

## Local Development Setup

You can run the entire application stack locally using Docker Compose for a one-command setup.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and Docker Compose

### Running with Docker Compose (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to get started. It will spin up the backend server and a PostgreSQL database.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/CloudNotes.git
    cd CloudNotes
    ```

2.  **Start the services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    - The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
    - The PostgreSQL database will be available at `localhost:5432`.

3.  **Run the frontend separately:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
    - The frontend application will be running at `http://localhost:3001`.

### Manual Local Setup

If you prefer to run the services manually:

1.  **Start the database:**
    You can use the Docker Compose command to start only the database:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d db
    ```

2.  **Run the backend:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    cp .env.example .env # Create a .env file and configure it
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Run the frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

## Azure Deployment & CI/CD

This section outlines the process for deploying CloudNotes to Azure and setting up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using GitHub Actions.

### 1. Provision Azure Resources

We use Bicep to define our infrastructure as code. The `azure/azcli-setup.sh` script provides a guided way to deploy all the necessary resources.

1.  **Log in to Azure:**
    ```bash
    az login
    ```

2.  **Configure and run the setup script:**
    - Open `azure/azcli-setup.sh` and fill in the placeholder values at the top of the file.
    - Run the script:
      ```bash
      bash azure/azcli-setup.sh
      ```
    This script will create a resource group and deploy all the services defined in `bicep/main.bicep`. It will output the names of your created resources.

### 2. Configure Secrets in Key Vault

For the application to connect to the database and storage, you must store secrets securely in Azure Key Vault. Refer to the `docs/connection-guides/key-vault.md` guide for detailed steps.

### 3. Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions

The repository includes GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD, enabling automated builds and deployments.

-   **CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):** Automatically runs tests on every push to `main` for both frontend and backend.
-   **CD (`.github/workflows/cd-deploy.yml`):** A manually triggered workflow to build and deploy the backend container to Azure App Service. This workflow also includes a foundational setup for frontend deployment (e.g., building the frontend assets). To use it, you'll need to set up GitHub secrets (`AZURE_CREDENTIALS`, `ACR_USERNAME`, `ACR_PASSWORD`).

## Learning Path: 30-Day Connection Plan

## Security Checklist

-   [ ] **No Secrets in Code**: Ensure no passwords or connection strings are hardcoded. Use environment variables locally and Key Vault in Azure.
-   [ ] **Managed Identities**: The Bicep template configures Managed Identities for the App Service and Function App. Use them to access other Azure resources securely.
-   [ ] **Key Vault Access Policies**: Configure Key Vault access policies to grant the minimum required permissions to your services.
-   [ ] **CORS**: Configure CORS policies on your storage accounts and App Service to only allow requests from your frontend's domain.

## Cost Control

This project uses services that have free tiers or are low-cost, but it's essential to manage your resources to avoid unexpected bills.

-   **Choose Low-Cost SKUs**: The Bicep templates are configured to use basic, low-cost SKUs (e.g., `B1` for App Service).
-   **Set Budgets**: Create a budget in the Azure portal for your resource group to get alerted when costs approach a certain threshold.
-   **Clean Up**: When you are finished with the project, you can delete the entire resource group to remove all associated resources and stop incurring costs.
    ```bash
    az group delete --name <YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --yes --no-wait
    ```

Happy learning!
